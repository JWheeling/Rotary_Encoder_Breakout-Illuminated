[*SparkFun Rotary Encoder Breakout - Illuminated (RG/RGB) (BOB-11722)*](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11722)

This is a clever little breakout board for both the RGB and R/G illuminated rotary encoders. 
On one side, it breaks out all of the RGB pins to standard, breadboard friendly, 0.1" headers. 
Turn it over and it has a footprint for the R/G version!
